In case you are someone who appreciates 80's styled calculator just like the one in the picture above, then this program may a pretty good fit for you.

Calculator App is a simple calculator which allows you to perform basic operations through the terminal. Pretty much made for math geeks ðŸ§® ðŸ¤“

Calculator App is written in Python and you can launch it either from any local IDE which is able to compile Python source code, or any other Python code editors/compilers from the web which enable you to edit and run the code.
